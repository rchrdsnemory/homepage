I'm a Senior Data Scientist at [Prodigy Education](https://www.prodigygame.com/main-en/). 

I received a PhD in Applied Cognitive Science from the University of Guelph's [College of Social and Applied Human Sciences](https://www.uoguelph.ca/csahs/) in 2017. As the top student in my doctoral cohort, I was honoured with the university's "most prestigious convocating graduate award," the [John Vanderkamp Doctoral Graduate Medal](https://www.uoguelph.ca/registrar/calendars/graduate/2017-2018/gradawards/gradawards-csahs.shtml). 

I'm an experienced data and research scientist, having worked in academia for more than 10 years and in industry at health-tech and ed-tech startups for more than 7 years.

I'm passionate about applying research and data science to improve decision-making at organizations that want to help people and improve society.
