If she keeps two-inch fish in the second tank and three-inch fish in the first tank, how many more fish would Gail have in the first tank than the second tank if one of the first tank fish eats another?","answer":"1"},{"is_correct":true,"solution":"First, let's find the size of the second tank. Since the first tank is twice the size of the second tank and there are 48 gallons of water in the first tank, the second tank must have 48\/2 = 24 gallons of water.\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of fish in each tank. In the second tank, Gail keeps two-inch fish, so the number of fish in the second tank is 24\/2 = 12 fish.\n\nIn the first tank, Gail keeps three-inch fish. Since she follows the rule of one gallon of water per inch of fish, there are 48\/3 = 16 fish in the first tank.\n\nIf one fish from the first tank eats another fish, the number of fish in the first tank would be reduced by 1. Therefore, Gail would have 16 - 1 = 15 fish in the first tank.\n\nThe difference in the number of fish between the first and second tanks would be 15 - 12 = 3 fish. Therefore, Gail would have 3 more fish in the first tank than the second tank if one fish from the first tank eats another.","question":"Gail has two fish tanks.
