To solve the problem, follow these steps:

1. Find the size of the second tank by dividing the size of the first tank by 2.
2. Determine the number of fish that can be kept in each tank based on the rule of one gallon of water per inch of fish.
3. Calculate the number of fish that can be kept in the second tank by dividing the size of the second tank by 2.
4. Calculate the number of fish that can be kept in the first tank by dividing the size of the first tank by 3.
5. Subtract 1 from the number of fish in the first tank to account for one fish eating another.
6. Subtract the number of fish in the second tank from the number of fish in the first tank to find the difference.
7. Determine the final answer, which is the difference in the number of fish between the two tanks.
